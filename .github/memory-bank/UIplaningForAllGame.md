# UI Plan for **Minipoll** Game

## Current UI Components (Implemented)

**Splash/Intro Sequence:** *\[Planned]* The game begins with a splash screen sequence that plays studio and game logo animations followed by a loading screen. This sequence is managed by a **SplashScreenManager** (currently disabled) which fades in/out panels:

* **Studio Splash Panel:** Full-screen panel showing the studio’s logo and tagline (centered text). It appears for \~2.5s then fades out.
* **Game Logo Panel:** Full-screen panel with the game title (large text and icon) that fades in and scales up (“bounce” entrance). Stays \~3s then fades out.
* **Loading Panel:** Full-screen overlay with a progress **Slider** and “Loading…” text. Displays after the logo, simulating load progress, then transitions to the main menu.

*Purpose:* Provide a branded intro and allow the game to load in the background. The sequence is skippable by user input. On completion (or skip), it automatically loads the Main Menu scene.

**Main Menu Screen:** This is the first interactive UI. It uses a **Canvas** with a background (e.g. looping Minipoll video) and menu buttons that appear with a nice animation. The **MenuButtons** panel (centered) contains:

* **“Play” Button:** A prominent button (center screen) to start the game. When clicked, it triggers a bounce-click animation and then fades out the intro video before loading the game scene. (Controlled by **MenuButtonsAnimationController** and **SimpleEntranceManager** – the latter handles fading out the video and scene transition.)
* **“Settings” Button:** A button (below Play) intended to open settings. Currently, it will attempt to load a `SettingsScene` if defined (placeholder; no settings menu is implemented yet). If the scene is missing, it logs that a settings panel would open.
* *(Optional)* **“Quit” Button:** *(Not explicitly in code, but recommended for desktop.*) Would exit the game – not present in the current UI.
* **Animated Transitions:** The menu buttons are animated to enter after the intro. They may scale in with a slight delay stagger. On hover/click, they play a scale bounce effect. These animations make the main menu feel lively.
* **Placement:** Center of the screen (Play and Settings stacked vertically). Often overlaid on the intro video background.

*Purpose:* Allow the player to start the simulation or adjust options. Controlled by the **MenuButtonsAnimationController** script (on the MenuButtons UI object), which auto-assigns the Play/Settings buttons and hooks up their OnClick events. The main menu UI becomes visible after the entrance sequence completes.

**Game HUD (In-Game Heads-Up Display):** Once the **Game Scene** is loaded, a persistent HUD provides simulation info and controls. This is rendered on a **Canvas** (probably anchored to screen edges) and managed by the **UIManager**. Key HUD elements include:

* **Day Counter:** Text (likely top-left) showing the current day count in the simulation (e.g. “Day: X”). Updated each new day.
* **Weather Indicator:** Text near Day showing current weather (“Weather: Sunny/Rainy”). Updated on weather change events.
* **Time of Day:** Text (perhaps top-center or top-left) showing the in-game clock time (HH\:MM) updated every frame.
* **Minipoll Count:** Text (top-left) showing number of creatures alive (“Minipolls: N”). Updates when a minipoll spawns or is removed.
* **Game Speed Control:** A slider (likely top-right) to adjust game speed, with an adjacent label displaying the speed (e.g. “Speed: 1.0x”). The player can drag this **Slider** to alter simulation speed; UIManager listens and updates the GameManager’s speed value.
* **Pause Button:** A button (top-right, near the speed control) to pause/unpause the game. On click, it toggles the game state to **Paused** via GameManager. *(If on desktop, the **Esc** key also triggers pause.)*

*Placement:* HUD texts are likely anchored at the top of the screen (day/weather on left; time perhaps center; speed slider on right). The styling is minimal and informative (TextMeshPro for crisp text).

*Purpose:* Provide ongoing simulation status and basic controls. The UIManager updates these elements in real-time (each frame or via events).

**Pause Menu:** When the game is paused, a **Pause Menu Panel** is shown as an overlay. This is a semi-transparent modal in the center:

* Likely contains a **“Resume”** button to unpause (hides the panel and returns to game).
* Possibly a **“Main Menu”** button (“Exit to Menu”) to quit the game session. A **BackToMenuButton** script was written (now disabled) to handle returning to the main menu scene, indicating this feature. Upon activation, it would set the game state to initializing and load the menu scene.
* Optionally could have **“Settings”** or **“Quit Game”** if needed.

The UIManager automatically enables this panel when the game enters a paused state and hides it when unpaused.

*Placement:* Center screen overlay (with dim background perhaps).
*Purpose:* Provide controls while game is halted. Controlled by **UIManager** (checks game state each frame and toggles the panel). Buttons on this panel would invoke UIManager or GameManager functions (Resume or exit).

**Minipoll Info Panel:** A contextual panel that appears when a specific creature (Minipoll) is selected by the player. This panel (likely anchored at a screen edge or bottom) displays details about the selected Minipoll:

* **Name Label:** The creature’s name is shown prominently.
* **Emotion Status:** The Minipoll’s current dominant emotion is displayed as text (e.g. “Happy”, “Sad”) along with an intensity meter (e.g. a **Slider** or bar). This updates continuously for the selected creature.
* **(Planned) Health Bar:** *Not yet in the UI.* The code has a hook for updating a health display, suggesting a health bar could be shown here (e.g. a small HP bar or percentage).
* **Needs/Stats:** *(Not currently shown, but see recommendations)* Could include hunger, energy, etc., if exposed.
* **Relationships List:** A container to list the creature’s relationships (friends, tribe members, etc.). Not yet populated in code – presumably would list names or icons of other Minipolls it knows.
* **Experiences/Memories List:** A container for notable memories or experiences (possibly a scrollable list of past events for that creature).

The panel is initially hidden. When the player clicks on a Minipoll in the world, **UIManager.SelectMinipoll** is called, which activates this panel and populates the data. Deselecting (or the creature being removed) hides the panel.

*Placement:* Likely anchored to a bottom corner or side of the screen, to not obscure the center view. It could be bottom-left or bottom panel.
*Purpose:* Provide detailed info on one creature and allow the player to monitor that creature’s status closely. Controlled by **UIManager** in response to selection events (raycast on click). Currently static display (no direct interactivity, just information).

**Tutorial Overlay UI:** When a new player starts, an in-game tutorial guides them with an overlay. The **TutorialUI** consists of a main tutorial panel that covers part of the screen with explanatory text and navigation controls:

* **Title, Message, Instruction Text:** Explanatory text fields. *Title* gives a short title for the step, *Message* provides details/story, and *Instruction* shows what action the player should do (flashes if waiting for input).
* **Illustration/Indicator:** Could include an image of the Minipoll or an indicator icon (e.g. an emoji showing the Minipoll’s emotion) to reinforce the tutorial point. A **minipollIndicator** is present for showing the creature’s emotional state in color during steps (e.g., turning yellow for “happy”).
* **Next/Skip Buttons:** Controls at the bottom of the tutorial panel. **“Next”** advances to the next hint (if the step is completed or not requiring action), and **“Skip”** allows the player to exit the tutorial early. These are interactive Buttons; clicking plays a sound and triggers TutorialManager to proceed or end.
* **Progress Slider:** A small progress bar indicating how far along the tutorial the player is.
* **Visual FX:** A particle **celebrationEffect** can play on certain completions (e.g. confetti when a tutorial milestone is reached). Text is revealed with a typewriter effect for a warm, gradual feel. The instruction text may blink to draw attention.

The tutorial UI is an overlay (likely semi-transparent background) that blocks gameplay input except for the required actions. It is shown at tutorial start and hidden on completion or skip. **TutorialManager** controls the flow: it displays steps via TutorialUI.DisplayStep() and waits for the player to perform actions like feeding or playing with the creature. The tutorial can highlight relevant UI (e.g. flashing the Feed button when instructing to feed) via a highlight system.

*Placement:* Center or bottom of the screen as an overlay, so the player can still see the game in the background. Likely covers lower portion with text, leaving the game view visible.
*Purpose:* Gently teach the player how to care for their Minipoll (feeding, playing, cleaning, etc.) with story-driven prompts. This UI is interactive (next/skip) and guided by **TutorialManager/TutorialUI** scripts.

## Recommended Additional UI Elements

Based on the game’s design (virtual creature simulation with social and economic systems), the following UI components should be added or refined. These suggestions include the UI element type, screen placement, controlling system, interactivity, and any animation/transition notes:

| **UI Element**                                 | **Type**                                           | **Screen Placement**                                                                             | **Controlled By**                                            | **Interactive?**                                           | **Notes (Animations/Transitions)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Feed Button** <br/>(Give Food)               | Button (with icon e.g. 🍎)                         | In-game HUD, perhaps bottom-center or a small **actions bar** near the bottom of the screen      | **UIManager** (calls a feeding method, e.g. in Needs system) | Yes (on click)                                             | Triggers feeding action for selected Minipoll (e.g. reduces hunger). Should highlight during tutorial steps. Use a quick scale or color flash on click for feedback.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Play Button** <br/>(Entertain)               | Button (icon e.g. ⚽)                               | Next to Feed button on the actions bar (bottom)                                                  | **UIManager** or a dedicated **InteractionController**       | Yes                                                        | Triggers a play interaction (increasing happiness or reducing boredom). Similar feedback animations (bounce on click). Tutorial highlights this for “play with your Minipoll” step.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Clean Button** <br/>(Hygiene)                | Button (icon e.g. 🧼)                              | Actions bar (bottom) alongside Feed/Play                                                         | **UIManager** or **NeedsController**                         | Yes                                                        | Triggers a cleaning action (increases cleanliness need). Provides an important care action (for tutorial and gameplay). Could animate (e.g. a brief sparkle on the Minipoll to show cleaning).                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Needs Status Panel**                         | Panel with multiple **progress bars** or **icons** | In-game HUD, could be a small panel above the actions bar or attached to the Minipoll Info panel | **UIManager** (updates values each frame or on change)       | Mostly static (display)                                    | Shows creature’s core needs (Hunger, Thirst, Energy, etc.) with colored bars or icons. For example, a hunger bar that decreases over time. This panel helps the player monitor needs at a glance. It can fade in/out or flash if a need is critical (to alert the player).                                                                                                                                  |
| **Health Bar** (Creature Life)                 | UI Slider/Bar                                      | Ideally above the selected Minipoll’s head in-world *and/or* in the Info panel                   | **UIManager** and **MinipollHealth** system                  | Static display                                             | Indicates the health of the creature. In Info Panel, it could be a horizontal bar labeled “Health.” Additionally, a small floating bar above each creature could visually show health (useful if multiple creatures). Should update on health change events (UIManager has a stub for this). Could flash red or shake if health is very low or if damage occurs.                                            |
| **Relationships List UI**                      | Scrollable list (within Info Panel)                | Inside the **Minipoll Info Panel** (likely a sub-panel)                                          | **UIManager** (populated from Minipoll’s Social/Tribe data)  | Possibly interactive (click a friend to focus/select them) | Lists the creature’s known friends or tribe members. Each entry might show a name and maybe an affinity score or icon. If interactive, clicking a name could switch the Info Panel to that Minipoll. Otherwise, it’s a static list for information. Should update when relationships change (e.g., new friend added).                                                                                       |
| **Memories/Experience Log**                    | Scrollable text or icons list                      | Inside **Minipoll Info Panel** below relationships                                               | **UIManager** (with data from MinipollMemorySystem)          | Static display                                             | Shows recent experiences of the selected Minipoll (e.g. “Played with X”, “Ate food”, “Had birthday on Day 5”). This gives the player narrative context. Likely not interactive. Could have a subtle fade-in when a new memory is added while the panel is open.                                                                                                                                             |
| **Global Currency Display**                    | Icon + Text                                        | Top of HUD (e.g. top-right corner)                                                               | **GameManager/EconomyManager** updates this                  | Static (info)                                              | Displays the player’s or tribe’s currency (e.g. coins) if the economy system is used (the game has a coin currency in MinipollEconomySystem). This would read from a global economy manager or the selected Minipoll’s coins. Useful if players buy items or manage resources.                                                                                                                              |
| **Inventory/Items Panel** *(optional)*         | Panel (modal or HUD) with item icons               | Possibly a button on HUD (e.g. “Backpack” icon) that opens an inventory window                   | **EconomyManager** or **InventoryController**                | Yes (item buttons)                                         | If the game allows collecting or buying items (food, toys, etc.), an inventory UI is needed. For example, clicking a food item in the inventory could apply it to the selected Minipoll (instead of a generic feed button). This panel might pause the game or overlay on the side. It could be a grid of item icons with counts. Not critical if gameplay is simplified, but scalable for future features. |
| **Build/Construction Menu** *(future feature)* | Panel with build options                           | Toggle via a “Build” button if world building is allowed (likely in a different mode or scene)   | **WorldManager/Economy**                                     | Yes                                                        | If players can place structures or objects (as hinted by a “World Economy” system), a build menu should list available structures and costs. This would appear when entering a build mode and allow the player to select an object to place in the world. Likely comes with a separate cursor or placement preview. (This is a speculative addition for advanced gameplay.)                                 |
| **Settings Menu**                              | Separate Scene or Modal Panel                      | If separate scene: full screen; if modal in main menu: center overlay                            | **SettingsController** or **UIManager** (if modal)           | Yes                                                        | A user-friendly settings UI for audio volume, controls, graphics, etc. This could be launched from the main menu’s Settings button. If in a scene, it would have a “Back” button to return to main menu. If implemented in-game, it could pause the game and overlay options. Use typical toggles/sliders for settings.                                                                                     |
| **Credits/About Screen** *(optional)*          | Scene or Panel                                     | From main menu (“About” or on game exit)                                                         | Static content                                               | Maybe interactive (back button)                            | Show project credits or story. Could be a simple scroll text or additional panel in main menu. Not essential for gameplay, but good for completeness (project identity as per branding task).                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Notifications/Alerts** *(optional)*          | Small pop-up text or icon alerts                   | Bottom or top of the screen, appearing temporarily                                               | **UIManager** or **NotificationSystem**                      | Static (timed, not clickable)                              | Brief alerts to inform the player of important events if they’re not actively watching the info panel (e.g. “Minipoll is starving!”, “Minipoll died 😢”). Could be an icon flashing or text that fades after a few seconds. Use animations like slide-in/out or fading. Tied to events (critical need reached, creature death, etc.). This keeps the player informed in a multi-creature scenario.          |

> **Note:** The tutorial code already anticipates some of these UI elements – for example, it searches for objects named `"FeedButton", "PlayButton", "CleanButton", "NeedsUI"`. Implementing the Feed/Play/Clean buttons and a Needs UI panel will fulfill these hooks and create a more complete caregiving interface.

All interactive elements should use consistent styling (colors, fonts) per the branding guide, and employ gentle animations (e.g. button hover effects, transitions) to match the game’s welcoming tone.

## UI Flow and Screen Transitions Map

Below is a textual map of the game’s screens and how the UI flows between them:

* **Splash Sequence → Main Menu:** On launch, the splash/intro plays (studio logo, game logo, loading bar). Afterwards (or if skipped), it auto-transitions to the **Main Menu** scene.
* **Main Menu Screen:** The player is presented with “Play” and “Settings” (and other menu options as added).

  * Choosing **Play** will start the game: the intro video (if any) fades out and the **Game Scene** is loaded. During this transition, the Menu UI might play an outro animation (e.g. button click shrink) and then unload.
  * Choosing **Settings** loads the **Settings Screen** (or opens a settings panel). In a separate Settings scene, the player can adjust options, then hit a **Back** button to return to Main Menu.
  * *(If implemented)* Choosing **Quit** would exit the application (on platforms where applicable).
* **Game Scene (Gameplay):** When the game scene loads, the **Game HUD** is immediately active, showing simulation info (day, time, etc.) and controls (speed, pause). The player now sees their Minipoll(s) in the world.

  * **Tutorial Overlay:** If it’s the player’s first time (or tutorial is enabled), the Tutorial UI will fade in over the HUD. The game might start paused or in a controlled state during the tutorial. The tutorial guides the player through feeding, playing, etc., highlighting the corresponding HUD buttons and waiting for input. As the player clicks “Next” or completes steps, the tutorial progresses. Once finished or skipped, the tutorial panel fades out, returning full control to the player.
  * **Normal Play:** The player can interact with the Minipoll and UI. Clicking on a Minipoll character will select it and open the **Minipoll Info Panel** on the HUD, showing that creature’s details. The player can use the action buttons (Feed/Play/Clean) to care for the creature – these trigger in-world effects and update needs/health immediately. The HUD continuously updates time, day, etc. in the background. Multiple creatures can exist; the player may click different ones to see their info, or none to hide the panel. The game runs until the player pauses or exits (there’s no fixed “win” state in a sandbox simulation).
  * **Pause Menu:** At any time, the player can pause via the pause button (or Esc key). This brings up the Pause Menu overlay, dimming the game. The simulation (time and creatures) is halted. From here:

    * Choosing **Resume** simply hides the pause overlay and unpauses the game, returning to where they left off.
    * Choosing **Main Menu** will exit the current game: the game scene unloads and the **Main Menu** scene loads back up. (A confirmation step could be added to avoid accidental loss of progress.) The transition would likely be a simple scene load (possibly a fade-out to the main menu).
    * *(If available)* **Settings** from pause could either bring up the settings panel (modal) or jump to a Settings scene and back.
* **Settings Screen:** If this is a separate scene (as indicated by `settingsSceneName` in the code), it acts like a mini-menu where the player adjusts options. After changes, the player hits **Back** (or **Apply & Back**) to return to whichever screen they came from (likely always Main Menu in this design). If the settings UI is a modal panel in the main menu, then it simply closes to reveal the main menu again.

**Screen Transition Summary:** The primary scene flow is *Splash* → *Main Menu* → *Game*. The **Main Menu** is the central hub: from it, you can go to Game or Settings (and from settings back to menu). The **Game** scene has an internal flow for pause and tutorial:

* In-game, the **HUD** and **Info panels** are part of the game scene UI (enabled/disabled as needed, not separate scenes).
* The **Pause Menu** and **Tutorial UI** are overlays within the game scene that temporarily take control, then yield back to gameplay. They do not require a scene change, just UI activation.
* Exiting the game returns to the Main Menu scene (allowing the player to start a new session or quit).

This UI map ensures a cohesive user experience: the player is guided from the intro into the menu, then into the game, with clear ways to adjust settings or pause and quit. Each screen’s UI components serve a distinct purpose, and their placement and control are designed for intuitive creature management and navigation of the game’s features. The recommended additions (care action buttons, needs panel, etc.) will fill in the interactive gaps, making the simulation’s mechanics accessible and visible to the player, thereby completing the UI needed for **Minipoll**.
