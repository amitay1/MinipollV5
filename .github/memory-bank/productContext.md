# Product Context: Minipoll Creature Simulation

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Modern games struggle to create genuine emotional connections between players and virtual characters. Most AI companions feel scripted, predictable, and ultimately disposable. Players quickly lose interest when characters don't evolve, remember interactions, or display believable autonomous behavior. Traditional pet simulation games rely on simple stat management rather than fostering true emotional bonds.

### Market Opportunity
- **AI-Driven Characters**: Growing demand for believable AI companions using ML-Agents
- **Emotional Gaming**: Increased interest in games that create deep emotional connections
- **Creature Simulation Revival**: Modern audience ready for sophisticated Tamagotchi-style experiences
- **Research Platform**: Academic and commercial interest in emotional UX and AI behavior
