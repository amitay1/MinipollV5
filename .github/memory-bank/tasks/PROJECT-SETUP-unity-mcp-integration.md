# [PROJECT-SETUP] - Unity MCP Integration Setup

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** July 4, 2025  
**Updated:** July 4, 2025

## Original Request
Initialize and configure Unity MCP bridge integration for AI-assisted Unity development, including VS Code setup, screenshot automation, and development environment preparation.

## Thought Process
The initial setup required establishing a working bridge between AI assistance in VS Code and Unity Editor through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This involved:

1. **MCP Server Configuration**: Setting up Python-based MCP server for Unity communication
2. **VS Code Integration**: Configuring Copilot Agent Mode with proper MCP settings
3. **Screenshot Automation**: Implementing Playwright for visual development documentation
4. **Environment Validation**: Testing the complete AI-Unity workflow

The approach prioritized getting a minimal viable integration working first, then expanding functionality as needed.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Install and configure Unity MCP Bridge package
- [x] Set up Python MCP server with proper port configuration
- [x] Configure VS Code Insiders with Copilot Agent and MCP settings
- [x] Install Playwright and browser dependencies for screenshot automation
- [x] Test AI-Unity communication with simple GameObject creation
- [x] Validate screenshot capture workflow
- [x] Clean up duplicate MCP server configurations
- [x] Document working configuration for future reference

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

## Progress Log

### July 4, 2025
- **Initial Setup**: Began Unity MCP Bridge installation and configuration
- **Challenge Encountered**: Multiple MCP server configurations causing conflicts
- **Resolution**: Cleaned up duplicate configurations in Claude Desktop and Cursor
- **Success**: AI successfully created Unity GameObjects through MCP bridge
- **Validation**: Screenshot automation working with Playwright
- **Documentation**: Completed comprehensive Memory Bank system
- **Status**: All setup objectives achieved, ready for core development

### Key Achievements
- **Working AI-Unity Bridge**: Bidirectional communication established
- **Visual Documentation**: Automated screenshot capture for development tracking
- **Stable Configuration**: Reliable MCP server connection on port 6400
- **Testing Validated**: Confirmed GameObject creation and manipulation capabilities
- **Environment Ready**: All development tools configured and operational

### Technical Decisions Made
- **MCP Server**: Chose Python implementation for reliability and community support
- **Port Configuration**: Port 6400 selected to avoid conflicts with other services
- **Screenshot Tool**: Playwright selected for cross-browser compatibility and reliability
- **Documentation**: Memory Bank system chosen for comprehensive knowledge management

### Lessons Learned
- **Configuration Management**: Importance of cleaning up duplicate MCP configurations
- **Testing Approach**: Value of simple test cases (GameObject creation) for validation
- **Documentation**: Real-time documentation critical for AI development workflows
- **Error Handling**: Need for robust error reporting in MCP bridge communications

## Final Outcome
Successfully established a fully functional AI-Unity development environment with:
- ✅ Unity MCP Bridge operational and tested
- ✅ VS Code Copilot Agent integrated with Unity
- ✅ Screenshot automation working reliably
- ✅ Complete documentation system in place
- ✅ Ready for core application development

This foundation enables efficient AI-assisted Unity development with visual progress tracking and comprehensive knowledge management through the Memory Bank system.
