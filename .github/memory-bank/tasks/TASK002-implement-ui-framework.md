# [TASK002] - Implement UI Framework

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** July 4, 2025  
**Updated:** July 4, 2025

## Original Request
Establish the Canvas structure and basic UI component hierarchy that will serve as the foundation for all user interface elements in the polling application.

## Thought Process
The UI framework needs to provide a solid foundation for the polling application's user interface. This involves:

1. **Canvas Structure**: Setting up proper Canvas components with appropriate render modes
2. **UI Hierarchy**: Creating organized parent objects for different UI sections
3. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring UI scales properly across different screen resolutions
4. **Component Templates**: Basic UI prefab templates for common elements
5. **Navigation System**: Framework for transitioning between different application states

The design will use Unity's uGUI system with Canvas components optimized for desktop platforms.

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Create main UI Canvas with Screen Space - Overlay render mode
- [ ] Set up Canvas Scaler for responsive design across resolutions
- [ ] Create UI hierarchy structure (MainMenu, PollCreation, Voting, Results)
- [ ] Add EventSystem for UI interaction handling
- [ ] Create basic UI style guide (colors, fonts, spacing)
- [ ] Implement basic UI prefab templates (Button, Panel, Text)
- [ ] Set up UI animation framework using Unity Animator
- [ ] Create UI state management system for canvas switching
