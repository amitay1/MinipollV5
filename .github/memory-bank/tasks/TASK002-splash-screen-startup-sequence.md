# [TASK002] - Splash Screen & Startup Sequence

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** July 4, 2025  
**Updated:** July 4, 2025

## Original Request

יצירת חוויית פתיחה מלאה מרגע שפותחים את המשחק עד לרגע שהתפריט מופיע עם PLAY, SETTINGS ואלמנטים נפוצים של משחק.

Create the complete opening experience from the moment the game launches until the main menu appears with PLAY, SETTINGS, and common game elements.

## Thought Process

הרצף הפתיחה הוא החשן הראשון של השחקן עם המשחק. צריך ליצור חוויה מקצועית שמכינה את השחקן לעולם של Minipoll ומציגה את הזהות הויזואלית שנוצרה ב-TASK001.

The opening sequence is the player's first impression of the game. We need to create a professional experience that prepares the player for the Minipoll world and showcases the visual identity created in TASK001.

Key considerations:

1. **Studio Logo**: הצגת HeartCode Studios
2. **Game Branding**: הצגת לוגו Minipoll עם האפקטים שלו
3. **Loading Process**: טעינה חלקה לתפריט הראשי
4. **Professional Feel**: תחושה של משחק AAA
5. **Emotional Setup**: הכנה רגשית לחוויית הקריטריה

## Implementation Plan

- [ ] Create Studio Logo splash screen with HeartCode Studios branding
- [ ] Design Minipoll game logo presentation with beautiful animations
- [ ] Implement loading system with progress indication
- [ ] Create smooth transitions between splash screens
- [ ] Design main menu UI with PLAY, SETTINGS, QUIT options
- [ ] Add background music and sound effects for emotional impact
- [ ] Implement scene management system for smooth transitions
- [ ] Apply TASK001 branding system throughout all UI elements
- [ ] Add accessibility options (skip splash, sound toggle)
- [ ] Test startup sequence on different platforms
