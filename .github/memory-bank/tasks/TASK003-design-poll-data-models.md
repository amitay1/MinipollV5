# [TASK003] - Design Poll Data Models

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** July 4, 2025  
**Updated:** July 4, 2025

## Original Request
Create ScriptableObject-based poll system and data structures for voting functionality that will handle all poll data management in the application.

## Thought Process
The poll data model system needs to be flexible, scalable, and easy to work with in Unity. Key considerations:

1. **ScriptableObject Architecture**: Using Unity's ScriptableObject system for data persistence and easy inspector editing
2. **Poll Structure**: Design polls to support multiple question types (multiple choice, yes/no, rating)
3. **Vote Management**: Track votes, prevent duplicate voting, calculate results
4. **Data Persistence**: Save/load polls and voting data
5. **Extensibility**: Design system to easily add new poll types and features

The system should be modular and support both local and potential future networked voting scenarios.

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Create base Poll ScriptableObject class with core properties
- [ ] Design Question data structure with multiple choice support
- [ ] Implement Vote tracking and validation system
- [ ] Create PollManager for poll lifecycle management
- [ ] Add data serialization for save/load functionality
- [ ] Design poll results calculation and display system
- [ ] Create poll template system for quick poll creation
- [ ] Implement poll validation and error handling
