# [TASK001] - Create Core Scene Setup

**Status:** Pending  
**Added:** July 4, 2025  
**Updated:** July 4, 2025

## Original Request
Set up the main polling scene with proper lighting, cameras, and basic environment to serve as the foundation for the polling application interface.

## Thought Process
The core scene setup is fundamental to establishing a proper visual foundation for the polling application. This includes:

1. **Scene Architecture**: Creating a clean, organized scene structure
2. **Lighting Setup**: Establishing appropriate lighting for UI elements and potential 3D content
3. **Camera Configuration**: Setting up cameras for optimal UI rendering and potential transitions
4. **Environment Basics**: Adding basic environmental elements that support the polling theme

The approach will leverage Unity's URP capabilities while maintaining simplicity and performance.

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Create new main scene (MainPollingScene)
- [ ] Set up URP lighting with appropriate tone mapping
- [ ] Configure main UI camera with proper orthographic settings
- [ ] Add directional light for consistent lighting
- [ ] Create basic environment backdrop (optional gradient or solid color)
- [ ] Set up scene hierarchy with organized empty GameObjects for different systems
- [ ] Configure scene lighting settings for UI clarity
- [ ] Test scene performance and optimization
