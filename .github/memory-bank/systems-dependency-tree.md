## 🔄 Circular Dependency Warnings

### **Potential Issues to Avoid**
- **SAVE/LOAD ↔ SCENE LOADING**: Ensure scene loading doesn't depend on save system initialization
- **EVENT SYSTEM ↔ All Systems**: Prevent event system from depending on systems that depend on it
- **INTERACTION ↔ INVENTORY**: Careful ordering of item collection vs. interaction detection
- **AUDIO ↔ LOCALIZATION**: Avoid circular dependencies between audio and localized content

### **Resolution Strategies**
- **Dependency Injection**: Use interfaces to break circular dependencies
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use events to decouple systems
- **Initialization Order**: Careful system startup sequencing
- **Interface Segregation**: Break large dependencies into smaller, focused interfaces

## 🎯 System Communication Patterns

### **One-Way Dependencies (Safe)**
```
MINIPOLL PREFAB ARCHITECTURE → SCENE LOADING FLOW → SAVE/LOAD SYSTEM
LOCALIZATION SYSTEM → DIALOGUE & QUEST SYSTEM → INTERACTION SYSTEM
OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM → WEATHER SYSTEM → AUDIO REQUEST SOURCES
```

### **Bidirectional Dependencies (Requires careful management)**
```
EVENT SYSTEM ↔ All Systems (Central hub pattern)
SAVE/LOAD SYSTEM ↔ All Stateful Systems (State management pattern)
INTERACTION SYSTEM ↔ INVENTORY ACTIONS (User action pattern)
```

### **Service Dependencies (Clean pattern)**
```
Multiple Systems → AUDIO REQUEST SOURCES (Service pattern)
Multiple Systems → LOCALIZATION SYSTEM (Service pattern)
Multiple Systems → DEVELOPER TOOLS & DEBUG (Service pattern)
```

## 🏛️ Architectural Principles

### **Dependency Inversion**
- High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- Both depend on abstractions (interfaces)
- Abstractions don't depend on details

### **Single Responsibility**
- Each system has one clear responsibility
- Changes to one system don't cascade to others
- Clear boundaries between system functions

### **Open/Closed Principle**
- Systems are open for extension (via events/interfaces)
- Systems are closed for modification (stable core)
- New features added through composition, not modification

This dependency tree provides the blueprint for implementing the Minipoll creature simulation game with proper system architecture, avoiding circular dependencies, and ensuring maintainable, scalable code.
