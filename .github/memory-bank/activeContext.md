- ✅ **MCP Server Configuration**: Python MCP server running stable on port 6400
- ✅ **Core Scene Setup**: Created 02_GameScene with proper lighting, camera, and environment
- ✅ **3 Minipoll Creatures**: Spawned with MinipollCore, MinipollBrain, Health, Stats, Memory systems
- ✅ **Management Systems**: GameManager, MinipollManager, UIManager integrated and functional
- ✅ **Environment Objects**: Food sources, water sources, and interactive elements placed
- ✅ **AI Components**: Advanced creature AI systems successfully integrated into Unity scene

### Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Test Creature AI**: Verify MinipollCore and MinipollBrain systems are functional
2. **Add Visual Enhancements**: Creature color variation, emotion indicators, particle effects
3. **Implement Player Interaction**: Click-to-select creatures, feed/water interactions
4. **Create Prefab System**: Convert working Minipoll to reusable prefab for spawning
5. **UI Development**: Health bars, needs indicators, creature information panels

## Recent Changes

### Technical Changes (July 4, 2025)
- **MCP Configuration**: Cleaned up duplicate MCP server configurations
- **Playwright Installation**: Successfully installed all browser dependencies
- **VS Code Settings**: Configured proper MCP settings in workspace
- **Unity Package Integration**: Unity MCP Bridge package properly installed and functional

### Development Workflow Established
- **AI-Unity Bridge**: Direct GameObject creation and manipulation from VS Code
- **Visual Documentation**: Before/after screenshots for each major change
- **Real-time Feedback**: MCP server provides immediate Unity state updates
- **Error Handling**: Proper error reporting through MCP bridge

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architectural Decisions
- **UI Framework**: Using Unity's built-in UI system (uGUI) for reliability
- **Data Storage**: ScriptableObjects for poll templates, JSON for runtime data
- **Scene Structure**: Single-scene architecture with dynamic UI loading
- **Input System**: Unity's new Input System for cross-platform compatibility

### Development Methodology
- **AI-First Approach**: Leverage AI assistant for initial implementations
- **Visual Validation**: Screenshot every significant change for verification
- **Iterative Development**: Small, testable changes with immediate feedback
- **Documentation-Driven**: Memory bank updates with each major milestone

### Open Questions
- **Networking Strategy**: Local-only vs. future network capability preparation
- **Animation Framework**: Unity Animator vs. DOTween for UI animations
- **Data Persistence**: File-based vs. PlayerPrefs for poll storage
- **Platform Optimization**: Performance considerations for target platforms

## Current Environment Status

### Working Systems
- **Unity Editor**: Version 6000.1.8f1 running stable
- **Unity MCP Server**: Python server on port 6400, connected and responsive
- **VS Code Insiders**: Copilot Agent Mode enabled with MCP integration
- **Playwright**: Browser automation ready for screenshot capture
- **Git Repository**: Initialized with proper .gitignore for Unity projects

### MCP Server Configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unity-mcp-clean": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:\\Users\\Amita\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\UnityMCP\\UnityMcpServer\\src\\server.py"],
      "cwd": "C:\\Users\\Amita\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\UnityMCP\\UnityMcpServer\\src"
    }
  }
}
```

### Unity Package Status
- ✅ Unity MCP Bridge: Installed and functional
- ✅ Input System: Version 1.14.0
- ✅ Universal Render Pipeline: Version 17.1.0
- ✅ Visual Scripting: Version 1.9.8
- ✅ Test Framework: Ready for unit testing

## Development Standards

### AI Integration Patterns
- **Prefix Commands**: Use clear action verbs for Unity operations
- **Screenshot Protocol**: Capture before/after images for visual changes
- **Error Validation**: Always check Unity console after AI-generated changes
- **Progress Documentation**: Update memory bank after significant milestones

### Unity Development Standards
- **Naming Conventions**: PascalCase for public members, camelCase for private
- **Component Structure**: Single responsibility per MonoBehaviour
- **Asset Organization**: Clear folder structure in Assets directory
- **Scene Management**: Minimal scene dependencies, maximum reusability

### Code Quality Standards
- **Documentation**: XML comments for public APIs
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for all user-facing features
- **Performance**: Target 60 FPS on minimum system requirements
- **Accessibility**: Consider colorblind and motor accessibility

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **MCP Bridge Stability**: Regular connection monitoring and fallback procedures
- **Unity Version Compatibility**: Track Unity 6.1 updates and breaking changes
- **Screenshot Automation**: Backup manual documentation if Playwright fails
- **AI Assistant Reliability**: Manual verification of all AI-generated code

### Project Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Strict adherence to defined MVP features
- **Timeline Management**: Weekly milestone reviews and adjustments
- **Quality Assurance**: Continuous testing with each AI-generated change
- **Documentation Debt**: Real-time memory bank updates prevent knowledge loss

## Communication Protocols

### AI Assistant Instructions
- Always capture screenshots for visual changes
- Verify Unity console for errors after operations
- Update progress in memory bank after major milestones
- Use descriptive commit messages for version control

### Development Workflow
1. **Plan**: Define specific, testable objectives
2. **Implement**: Use AI assistant for code generation
3. **Validate**: Screenshot and test functionality
4. **Document**: Update memory bank with outcomes
5. **Commit**: Save progress with descriptive messages

This active context serves as the bridge between strategic planning and tactical implementation, ensuring the AI assistant has current, actionable information for effective Unity development assistance.
