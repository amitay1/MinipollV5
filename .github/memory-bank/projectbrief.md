# Project Brief: Minipoll V5

## Project Overview
Minipoll V5 is an innovative Unity-based creature simulation game where players form emotional bonds with a single autonomous creature called "Minipoll." This research-driven project explores advanced AI, progressive game design, and emotional UX to create a living companion that evolves through ML-Agents and Utility AI systems.

## Core Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Emotional Creature Simulation**: Create a believable, responsive AI creature that players bond with emotionally
- **Advanced AI Integration**: Implement Unity ML-Agents and Utility AI for emergent creature behavior
- **Progressive Game Design**: Start simple with one creature, gradually unlock rich interactive systems
- **Emotional UX Design**: Foster deep emotional attachment using "Tamagotchi effect" principles

### Secondary Goals
- **Modular ECS Architecture**: Use Unity DOTS/ECS for scalable, high-performance simulation
- **Emergent Systems**: Implement memory, emotion, and learning systems for unique player narratives
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Utilize Unity MCP bridge for seamless AI-Unity development integration
- **Visual Progress Tracking**: Screenshot automation for development monitoring

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Single autonomous creature simulation with Minipoll character
- Unity ML-Agents integration for learned behaviors (movement, survival, social interaction)
- Utility AI system for high-level decision making and need prioritization
- Progressive game design with gradual feature unlocking
- Emotional UX design with expressive animations and diegetic interface
- Memory and emotion systems for creature development
- Modular ECS/DOTS architecture for performance and scalability
- AI-assisted development through Unity MCP bridge

### Out of Scope (for V5)
- Multiple creature ecosystems (focus on single Minipoll bond first)
- Advanced multiplayer interactions
- Commercial voice synthesis for creature speech
- Complex terrain generation systems
- Advanced physics simulation beyond basic needs

## Success Criteria
1. **Emotionally Engaging Minipoll**: Players form genuine attachment to their creature
2. **Believable AI Behavior**: ML-Agents and Utility AI create convincing autonomous behavior
3. **Progressive Unlocking**: Features unlock naturally as emotional bond deepens
4. **Performant Simulation**: ECS architecture maintains 60fps with complex AI systems
5. **Emergent Narratives**: Each player's journey becomes unique through creature memory/learning
6. **Working MCP Integration**: AI assistant can directly manipulate Unity objects for rapid development

## Technology Stack
- **Engine**: Unity 6000.1.8f1 (Unity 6.1) with Universal Render Pipeline (URP) 17.1.0
- **AI Framework**: Unity ML-Agents with Unity Sentis for model deployment
- **Architecture**: Unity DOTS/ECS for high-performance modular simulation
- **Animation**: Unity Animator with Blend Shapes, Mecanim, Timeline, and Cinemachine
- **Development Environment**: VS Code Insiders with Copilot Agent
- **AI Integration**: Unity MCP Bridge + Python MCP Server for AI-assisted development
- **Automation**: Playwright for screenshot capture and development tracking
- **Data Persistence**: Custom JSON/binary save system for creature memory and progress
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub integration

## Project Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Setup and MCP Integration (Completed - July 4, 2025)
- **Phase 2**: Core Minipoll Implementation (Basic creature, feeding, simple AI)
- **Phase 3**: ML-Agents Integration (Trained behaviors, adaptive learning)
- **Phase 4**: Emotional Systems (Memory, bonds, progressive unlocking)
- **Phase 5**: Polish and Emergent Features (Advanced interactions, unique narratives)

## Key Stakeholders
- **Developer**: Amita (Primary developer with AI assistance)
- **AI Assistant**: GitHub Copilot with Unity MCP capabilities for rapid development
- **Research Focus**: Emotional UX and AI-driven creature simulation
- **Platform**: Unity 6.1 ecosystem with ML-Agents toolkit

## Risk Factors
- **ML-Agents Complexity**: Training effective creature behaviors requires expertise
- **Emotional Design Challenge**: Creating genuine player attachment is subjective
- **Performance with AI**: Complex AI systems may impact performance without proper ECS optimization
- **MCP Integration Stability**: Dependency on Unity MCP bridge for AI-assisted development
- **Progressive Design Balance**: Unlocking features too slowly/quickly can break engagement

## Project Charter
This project serves as both an emotionally engaging creature simulation game and a research exploration of AI-driven character development. The successful completion demonstrates the viability of combining Unity ML-Agents, Utility AI, and emotional UX design to create virtual beings that players genuinely care about, while leveraging AI-assisted development for rapid iteration.
