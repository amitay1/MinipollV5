## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

1. **Add GameSceneMaster to the scene:**

   ```
   1. Create empty GameObject in 02_GameScene
   2. Name it "GameSceneMaster"
   3. Add GameSceneMaster component
   4. Leave all settings at default
   5. GameSceneMaster will automatically setup everything on Start
   ```

2. **Verify Setup:**
   - Check Console for "✅ GameSceneMaster: Complete setup finished successfully!"
   - Look for Feed/Play/Clean buttons at bottom of screen
   - Verify NeedsUI panel appears in top-left when Minipoll selected

### Manual Setup (Advanced)

If you prefer to add components individually:

1. Add `GameSceneUIBuilder` to scene and call `CreateGameSceneUI()`
2. Add `MinipollClickHandler` to enable creature selection
3. Add `TutorialUIIntegration` for tutorial compatibility
4. Add `GameSceneSetup` for validation and testing

## 🎮 Gameplay Flow

1. **Scene starts** → UI elements automatically created
2. **Player clicks Minipoll** → Creature selected, NeedsUI shows, buttons enabled
3. **Player clicks Feed/Play/Clean** → Action performed, tutorial events triggered
4. **Player clicks elsewhere** → Creature deselected, UI hides

## 🎓 Tutorial Integration

The system is designed to work seamlessly with the existing tutorial:

- **Button Highlighting**: Tutorial can highlight specific buttons
- **Event Notifications**: Actions trigger tutorial completion events
- **Required Objects**: Creates exactly the objects tutorial expects:
  - "FeedButton"
  - "PlayButton"
  - "CleanButton"
  - "NeedsUI"

## 🔧 Testing & Validation

### Context Menu Commands (GameSceneMaster)

- **🎮 Setup Complete Game Scene** - Creates all UI components
- **📊 Show Status Report** - Displays current setup status
- **🧪 Test All Features** - Runs comprehensive feature test
- **🔄 Force Recreate Everything** - Cleans and recreates all UI
- **🗑️ Cleanup All Components** - Removes all created components

### Validation Checks

The system automatically validates:

- ✅ All required UI elements exist
- ✅ Minipoll creatures are present in scene
- ✅ UI controller and click handler are active
- ✅ Tutorial integration is connected

## 🎨 Styling & Branding

- Uses existing `UIBrandingExtensions` for consistent styling
- Feed button: Green (success color)
- Play button: Blue (primary color)
- Clean button: Yellow (secondary color)
- Follows Minipoll brand guidelines

## 🔗 System Integration

### Connects With

- **MinipollCore** - Creature systems for applying actions
- **UIManager** - Existing UI management system
- **TutorialSystem** - For guided gameplay
- **GameManager** - For overall game state

### Events & Callbacks

- `OnFeedButtonClicked`
- `OnPlayButtonClicked`
- `OnCleanButtonClicked`
- Selection change events
- Tutorial step completion events

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Buttons not appearing:**
   - Check Console for UI creation messages
   - Run GameSceneMaster.SetupCompleteGameScene()
   - Verify Canvas exists in scene

2. **Buttons not clickable:**
   - Ensure Canvas has GraphicRaycaster
   - Check if buttons are behind other UI
   - Verify EventSystem exists in scene

3. **Minipoll selection not working:**
   - Check if Minipolls have colliders
   - Verify camera is tagged "MainCamera"
   - Ensure MinipollClickHandler is in scene

4. **Tutorial not working:**
   - Verify objects named exactly: "FeedButton", "PlayButton", "CleanButton", "NeedsUI"
   - Check TutorialUIIntegration is connected
   - Ensure tutorial system can find the objects

### Debug Commands

```csharp
// In Console or Debug script:
GameSceneMaster master = FindFirstObjectByType<GameSceneMaster>();
master.ShowStatusReport();
master.TestAllFeatures();
```
